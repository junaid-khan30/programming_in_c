Header File : 


think of it as whenever we have a book , the context of that page is first one 

for software folks , its very imp to know the entry point and end point 

printf function is inportet from stdio.h 

its mandatory to name main() as main() only, for eg i name it as junaid, 
what will happen it won't work
