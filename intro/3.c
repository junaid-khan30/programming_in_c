/* 
Header File : 

main(): Every C Program has a primary function that must be named as main()
The main() function acts as a starting point for the program execution 
you can have n number of function , but the starting func is main()


printf function is inportet from stdio.h 

its mandatory to name main() as main() only, for eg i name it as junaid, 
what will happen it won't work
